<h1>
  My testimony
</h1>
<p>This week was the first week of new testament class. I could feel the class discussion was vigorous. I've never felt this way before. Every time I only study with a small group. Especially growing up as the only member of the church in my youth, I only study with a small group of people. I was excited to learn about different views on the new testament. When we talked about Exegesis and Eisegesis I just thought of the different view of the scripture. Often, I take scriptures for granted, and I didn’t notice so much of a difference from different writer. I didn’t pay attention do the background and the history behind the scripture. From the reading and class lecture, I appreciate more of the early saints at Christ time who keep the record and spread the gospel. I also appreciate the compiler who quoted Christs word. I understand that there are many ways to understand the new testament. For example, Historiography is the study of who, when, where and to whom. Hermeneutics is the science of interpretation, especially of the scriptures. The other thing I learned from the class is that after taking several religion class at BYU. I always feel these religion classes are center on the gospel of Jesus Christ. Even though it has a lot of new information to learn. These classes always focused on the most important things, such like faith, love, repentance and enduring to the end. The biggest thing I learned from this Thursday is that we should love God and love our neighbor. I always felt having this in mind makes my life better. In the end, It is important to ponder and think about the meaning behind the scripture. It will enhance my learning experience. So I’ve made a goal to meaningfully study new testament this semester.</p>

    Thoughts about new Testament
  </h2>
  <p>
    No one can understand God’s life. So far there have been many attempts for mankind to write the story of Jesus Christ. Even though we don’t understand the background of the time. The writing of different apostles could only be recording few stories of Christ. I am awed by the perfect responds by Jesus Christ almost every time. I’m aware of how great and perfect Christ is. From his earthly ministering, I felt his power and infinite love. This week Our assignment is to watch a bible video about Mark. I didn’t really pay attention to a lot of stories before. But this time I found many new insights. Especially when Jesus replied to the non-believer with the perfect answer. It strengthened my testimony. I understood that He is our Savior and our redeemer. The love he gave me to do good is incredible. I am grateful for His atonement and his willingness to be our Savior.
“It is not by chance or coincidence that we have the Bible today. Righteous individuals were prompted by the Spirit to record both the sacred things they saw and the inspired words they heard and spoke.” – Russell Ballard. I love how Professor Sharp mentioned members of the church often put too much emphasis on the correct translation of the bible. Indeed, we should also focus on knowing Bible is God’s word. I could feel the hard work from early translators. They are righteous individuals. I appreciate their help of bringing bible to our days.
Professor Sharp gave us the background of the New Testament in the class. Compare to Book of Mormon. There are a lot of historical evidence in the New Testament. We can easy find the history background of the Middle East of that time. With these all in mind, I just again feel the New Testament is so true and it’s a vivid history around my life.
